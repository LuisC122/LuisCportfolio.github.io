Senior Year Projects 2022-2023
Hi, I'm Luis Castillo.
I'm interested in video games, video editing, and being a teacher. 
I'm currently learning how to use jquery to create websites and give them special functions.
I'm looking to collaborate on several projects with my classmates that push our knowledge of jquery.
I can be reached at Luisc122@nycstudents.net, and Lcas1692@taehs.org
